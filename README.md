#### Navigate a 3D world as a cube, dodging obstacles in this fast-paced action game. Use the left and right keys to steer and test your reflexes!
I started this project to learn Unity and C#, aiming to create my own game. I really enjoyed working on it and hope you enjoy playing it too! :D

## 🔗 Tutorial References
- [Brackey's "How to make a Video Game in Unity"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik) on YouTube. I used this as a guide and expanded on it by adding more elements.
- [Practical Programming's "3D ENDLESS RUNNER IN UNITY"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUVtQwKbZ-c). This helped me randomize the occurrence of obstacles and create endless ground tiles.

Thank you for checking out my project! Stay tuned for updates and improvements 🐋
