# 🎮 First Game Dev Project - Unity

Welcome to my first ever game development project! 🚀

### [v1.0 Download (07/17/2024 ~ 07/20/2024)](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1eXQo3V9vhRr7_bFNMDC1At2BDctHdAND)
For Mac users, if you see a warning about a malicious app, please right-click on the game and select "Open." This will bring up a dialog box with an option to open the installer.

### v2.0 (07/20 ~ Work in progress)

## 📚 Introduction
I started this project to learn Unity and C# with the goal of creating my own game. 
I really enjoyed working on it so hope you enjoy it too :D

## 🔗 Tutorial Reference
I used [Brackey's "How to make a Video Game in Unity"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik) on YouTube as a guide and expanded upon it by adding more elements. 

I also referred to [Practical Programming's "3D ENDLESS RUNNER IN UNITY"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUVtQwKbZ-c) to randomize the occurrence of obstacles and create endless ground tiles.

Thank you for checking out my project! Stay tuned for updates and improvements 🐋
