# 🎮 First Game Dev Project - Unity

Welcome to my first ever game development project! 🚀

### [v1.0 Download (07/17/2024 ~ 07/20/2024)](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1eXQo3V9vhRr7_bFNMDC1At2BDctHdAND)
**For Mac users:** If you see a warning about a malicious app, right-click on the game and select "Open." This will bring up a dialog box with an option to open the installer.

##### Features
- A 3D game where you move the player left and right to avoid obstacles.
- Four levels with an increasing number of obstacles.
- If you bump into an obstacle, the game automatically restarts at the same level.
- The score is calculated based on the player's distance moved.

### v2.0 (07/20 ~ Work in progress)

## 📚 Introduction
I started this project to learn Unity and C#, aiming to create my own game. I really enjoyed working on it and hope you enjoy playing it too! :D

## 🔗 Tutorial References
- [Brackey's "How to make a Video Game in Unity"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik) on YouTube. I used this as a guide and expanded on it by adding more elements.
- [Practical Programming's "3D ENDLESS RUNNER IN UNITY"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUVtQwKbZ-c). This helped me randomize the occurrence of obstacles and create endless ground tiles.

Thank you for checking out my project! Stay tuned for updates and improvements 🐋
