## 📚 Introduction
I started this project to learn Unity and C# with the goal of creating my own game. 
I really enjoyed working on it so hope you enjoy it too :D



## 🔗 Tutorial Reference
I used [Brackey's "How to make a Video Game in Unity"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik) on YouTube as a guide and expanded upon it by adding more elements. 
I also referred to Practical Programming's [3D ENDLESS RUNNER IN UNITY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUVtQwKbZ-c&t=321s) to randomize the occurrence of obstacles and create endless ground tiles.

Thank you for checking out my project! Stay tuned for updates and improvements 🐋
