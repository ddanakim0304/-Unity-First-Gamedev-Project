## ðŸ“š Introduction
I started this project to learn Unity and C# with the goal of creating my own game. 
I really enjoyed working on it so hope you enjoy it too :D



## ðŸ”— Tutorial Reference
I used [Brackey's "How to make a Video Game in Unity"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik) on YouTube as a guide and expanded upon it by adding more elements.



Thank you for checking out my project! Stay tuned for updates and improvements. ðŸŒŸ
